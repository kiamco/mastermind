## How I made the game

  I made the game with the use of javascript, react, html/css, and SASS. I used react hooks instead of the usual class components, also used React's context api instead of redux. The reason why I used context API is because I watched an in interview with Dan Abramov (co-author of Redux), he mentioned something about context API that made me really excited to to test it out. I also deployed the mastermind game so that it would be easy to access.
