## How I made the game

  I made the game with the use of javascript, react, html/css, and SASS. I used react hooks instead of the usual class components, also used React's context api instead of redux. The reason why I used context API is because I watched an in interview with Dan Abramov (co-author of Redux), he mentioned something about context API that made me really excited to to test it out. I also deployed the mastermind game through zeit.co so it would be easy to access. The reason why I chose react is because I have a few small games already made with react, and I plan on combining all of these game projects into one web app.
